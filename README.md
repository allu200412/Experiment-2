Title of the Experiment
Design and Development of a Web-Based Word Counter Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Defined Approach
The objective of this experiment is to design and implement a simple web-based application using basic web technologies.

The project is developed using the following approach:

HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage.
CSS is used to style the webpage and design the layout, including background colors, text alignment, and spacing.
JavaScript is used to implement functionality such as counting the number of words entered by the user in real time.
Multiple experiments are combined into a single website using a main index.html file. Navigation between experiments is achieved using JavaScript, and separate experiment files are displayed using iframe integration. The project is hosted on GitHub and deployed using Netlify to make it accessible online.
